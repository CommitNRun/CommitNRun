ðŸ“Œ Project Idea
To build, containerize, and monitor a functional URL shortener webservice. The 
entire stack, including the application and its monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), will run 
locally using Docker.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
This project involves creating a webservice that shortens URLs, stores the 
mapping, and handles redirects. You will then instrument this service to expose custom 
performance metrics. Finally, you will use Prometheus to collect these metrics and Grafana to 
build a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing the service's health and usage patterns.
